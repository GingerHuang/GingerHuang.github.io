# Education
============
* M.S. in King's College London, 2020-2021
* B.Eng. in Shandong University, 2015-2019

# Work experience
===========

## Research Assistant   
Nanjing University's Medical School   Sept 2022-present
* Responsibility:  I finished four projects, conducted literature reviews, drafted the publication writing in the postdoctoral centre, provided consultation on modelling to medical graduate students (without machine learning background), and supported departmental administrative tasks
* Deep Learning: I designed the psychological testing platform in collaboration with the Psychiatry Department, including measuring and analysing EEG, scales and facial expressions data by combining ARIMA and conv-LSTM to identify patterns of anxiety and depression patients
* Model Optimisation: I applied SVM and Queuing theory models to optimise the procedures of outpatient
* Knowledge Graph: I designed an illness inferencing method by using the Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based on physical examination results and the correlation of diseases, and detecting potential illnesses for patients
* Strategies Improvement: I deployed and fine-tuned large language models (LLM) to improve clinical diagnosis and research efficiency in several clinical departments

## Research Collaborations   
with Tongji University   Jan 2024-present
* Innovative Strategy: I applied the causal inference and deep Q-learning model to analyse the Navigation safety and economic efficiency of Arctic shipping routes optimisation and compared it with some traditional models, such as Bayesian Decision Tree and Fuzzy Expertise Systems (ongoing)
* Practical Application: We applied Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to the pharmaceutic molecular retrosynthesis and achieved the SOTA compared to other retrosynthesis prediction methods.
